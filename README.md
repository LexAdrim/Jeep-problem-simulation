# Simulation of an optimisation problem

This app simulates the jeep problem. The jeep problem is a mathematical problem in which a jeep must maximize the distance it can travel into a desert with a given quantity of fuel. The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert.

This application allows the simulation of a jeep's journey through several relay points. The initial conditions of the problem are adjustable and a console records each action carried out in the application. It also integrates an optimal calculation of the maximum attainable distance.
